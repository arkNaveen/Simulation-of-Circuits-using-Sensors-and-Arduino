# Simulation-of-Circuits-using-Sensors-and-Arduino
Circuits are being implemented with the help of Arduino IDE and being simulated by TInkercad from Autodesk.Various sensors are used here.
# First Circuit - Temperature and Soil Monitoring System
A temperature and soil monitoring circuit system is designed to monitor temperature and soil moisture levels in a specific environment, such as a greenhouse, garden, or plant nursery. The system uses sensors like the soil moisture and temperature sensors to collect data and provides real-time information for better plant care and environmental control.
# Second Circuit - Ultrasonic based Alarm System
The Ultrasonic-Based Alarm System is designed to detect and alert users about the presence of objects or individuals within a specified range using ultrasonic technology. It utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance and triggers an alarm when an object or person comes within a predefined proximity range (<25 cm).The Ultrasonic-Based Alarm System provides a reliable solution for proximity detection, enabling users to create a more secure environment.
# Third Circuit - A Light Intesity Measuring System that takes Two Sensor Inputs 
The Light Intensity Detection system with a slide switch is designed to monitor and measure the light intensity in an environment using a photoresistor and an ambient light sensor. The system provides the ability to switch between the two sensors, allowing users to monitor and compare the readings from each sensor for more accurate light intensity method.
